# GoA Reverse ROM FAQ

**What does this do?**
This mod reverses the visit order. This means that BC2 comes first, and finishing it will let you access BC1. Areas not directly related to the 2nd visit will be blocked off. The battle level between the visits have also been swapped, so no need to worry about being underlevelled.

**Why does things not work?**
Make sure you're not using any other GoA, whether the usual PNACH, some other Lua version, or something from a plando. Make sure that your OpenKH and PCSX2-EX are updated, too.

**Is there missable checks?**
Yes, there is. Make sure to get all the chests and optional popups before finishing a visit. You can use the journal to see if you've gotten everything.

**How is STT reversed?**
Each in-game Day is reversed except Day 1, which is bundled with Day 2 (since it has no check and no World Point). This means that STT goes Day 6 -> Day 5 -> Day 4 -> Day 3 -> Day 1 -> Day 2.

**How is HB reversed?**
Finishing HB2 unlocks CoR. Finishing CoR (including Transport to Remembrance) unlocks Heartless Manufactory, Mushroom XIII, and Sephiroth. Heartless Manufactory can be unlocked early using Membership Card as usual while Mushroom XIII does not require Proof of Peace anymore. Finally, beating Sephiroth unlocks HB1. CoR battle level has been changed to Pre-100AW, TtR to Pre-TR, and Sephiroth to Post-story.

**How is DC reversed?**
You will have to finish TR before you can access DC. Wisdom Form check still requires finishing DC fully.

**How is TWtNW reversed?**
Progress goes as normal, but the order of bosses are reversed. You will fight Xemnas I where you'd normally fight Roxas, Saix where you'd fight Xigbar, and so on. This reversal also includes the bonus level and popup rewards.

**Why doesn't the 1st visit unlock?**
Worlds with Absent Silhouettes require their respective AS to be beaten before the 1st visit will unlock. The battle level has been changed to be the arithmetic mean of the visits'. Each AS only have 1 check with the second being data-exclusive.

**How does Datas work?**
Data paths are hidden behind an out-of-place door while Data AS can be accessed by examining the portal post-story. Data AS' rewards are obtained separately from regular AS.

**Can I get an unbeatable seed when I don't miss any check?**
Sadly, yes. Having a Torn Page in Pooh's House means it is impossible to obtain along with whatever else is there. In addition, having all of a type of black magic (Fire, Blizzard, Thunder) behind Ag2 carpet will cause the rest of Agrabah to be inaccessible.

**Do I have to do the entire HT, Ag, and PL to unlock Cerberus Cup?**
Thankfully, no. You only have to beat Vexen, Lexaeus, and Groundshaker. You do still need to finish the entire DC, OC, and TWtNW to unlock their respective cups, though.

**Why can't I exit Twilight Town, Atlantica, or 100 Acre Wood?**
Ya gotta commit :P
